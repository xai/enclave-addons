# Upstream fingerprint for enclave's automatic update probe: the build the Amp
# CLI installer would fetch right now. AMP_VERSION is read exactly as install.sh
# reads it, so pinning the variable pins the probe with it and the probe cannot
# report a change the rebuild will not deliver.
#
# Amp versions carry a build timestamp and change several times a day, so left
# unpinned this probe reports a stale image far more often than a tool that
# cuts releases.
