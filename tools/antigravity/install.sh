# Not upstream's own installer (curl https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh
# | bash): that one resolves the build through a Cloud Run auto-updater
# manifest, downloads from a Google Cloud Storage bucket, then edits shell
# profiles and aliases that the image already provides. The GitHub release
# carries the same archive byte for byte (checked: the 1.2.5 asset's SHA-512
# equals the manifest's), is pinnable by tag, and sits on a host the allowlist
# covers anyway. GitHub publishes no checksum beside the asset, so the
# manifest is consulted for its SHA-512 whenever it describes the release
# being installed.

# without pinning check-update.sh means the update probe keeps reporting the
