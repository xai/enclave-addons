# The settings template is copied once, only when no settings.json exists yet,
# and agy rewrites that file sparsely: on exit it keeps just the keys whose
# value differs from the default it holds for the session, so enableTelemetry
# is gone from disk after the first run and the template never gets a second
# chance. Merging the defaults under the file (`defaults * .`) restores what
# was dropped and leaves everything the file still carries untouched -- which
# also means a key you flipped inside a session survives only as long as agy
# kept writing it down.
